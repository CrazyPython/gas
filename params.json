Any executable in your PATH named gas_yourplugin is useable with gas.\r\nThis means you can write extensions for gas in any language you want, the only thing you need to do is make it accessable by putting it in PATH.\r\n\r\nAn example plugin exists at https://github.com/walle/gas_stats it's written in ruby, and distributed with rubygems. But this is not a requirement.\r\n\r\n## Plugins <a id=\"plugins\"></a>\r\n\r\n### Available plugins\r\n\r\n#### gas_stats\r\n\r\nShows usage statistics for gas. Serves as a reference implementation of a plugin.\r\n\r\nCode: https://github.com/walle/gas_stats\r\n\r\nInstallation: $ gem install gas_stats\r\n\r\nAuthor: [Fredrik Wallgren](https://github.com/walle)\r\n\r\n#### gas_ssh\r\n\r\nAdds ssh support for gas.\r\n\r\nWork in progress right now.\r\n\r\nCode: https://github.com/TheNotary/gas_stats\r\n\r\nInstallation: $ gem install gas_ssh\r\n\r\nAuthor: [TheNotary](https://github.com/TheNotary)"}
